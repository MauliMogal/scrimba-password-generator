# 🔐 Password Generator

This project was completed as part of the **JavaScript Fundamentals** module in [The Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack).

## 📌 Project Overview

The Password Generator is a frontend-only app built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript. It generates two secure, random passwords at the click of a button, each 15 characters long by default. The goal was to solidify JS fundamentals such as functions, arrays, string manipulation, and DOM interaction.

This was a **solo project**, designed to be done independently without direct code-alongs.
